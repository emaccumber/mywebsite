		<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

		<p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

		<p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

		<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
			<li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
			{identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
			<li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
			}
		</ul>
		<p>My skills are:</p>
		<ul>
			{skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
		</ul>
</BaseLayout>
