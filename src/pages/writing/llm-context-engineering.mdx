As large language models become central to more applications, context engineering has emerged as a critical skill. Here are the key principles I've learned from building production LLM systems.

## Start with Clear Instructions

The foundation of good context engineering is clarity. Your prompt should explicitly state what you want the model to do, in what format, and with what constraints.

**Bad:** "Analyze this data"  
**Good:** "Analyze the following sales data and provide three key insights in bullet point format, focusing on trends over the last quarter."

## Structure Your Context Hierarchy

Organize information by importance and relevance:

1. **System instructions** - Core behavior and role
2. **Immediate context** - Current task and constraints  
3. **Reference material** - Background information and examples
4. **User input** - The specific request

## Manage Token Budgets Strategically

Context windows are finite. Prioritize:
- Recent conversation history over distant context
- Task-specific examples over general knowledge
- Structured data over verbose explanations

## Use Examples Effectively

Few-shot examples are powerful but expensive. Choose examples that:
- Cover edge cases relevant to your use case
- Demonstrate the exact output format you want
- Show reasoning patterns, not just correct answers

## Test and Iterate

Context engineering is empirical. What works for one model or task may fail for another. Build systematic evaluation processes and be prepared to refine your approach based on real-world performance.

The best context engineering combines technical precision with deep understanding of your specific domain and use case.
